## Kafka Test Broker for the JVM

This is a work in progress...

This project is a result of me studying Kafka and its protocol. I wanted to write a zero-dependency mini Kafka broker in Java that would support basic consume / produce API.

In the future I'd like to be able to use this broker as a replacement for embedded Kafka in integration tests that use it.
